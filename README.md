## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use percentages for responsive sizes with flexbox. Works much better generally.

### Continued development

I'm just getting to grips with css, so want to continue that. It made working with frontend libraries alot more difficult not knowing fundamental css.
